A reminder app is an application that helps users not to forget their schedules, appointments, and to-do lists. This app sends notifications at the time set by the user to provide advance notice of their schedules, making it useful for daily life.

Users can input their desired schedules within the app and set the date and time. They can also set notifications for their schedules.

## ðŸ‘º Technology Goals Targeted by the Reminder.
* MVI architecture. 
* Loose management using moduleization and DI (Dependency Injection).
* TDD (Let's maintain a coverage close to 100.)
